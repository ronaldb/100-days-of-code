##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: December 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML5 and CSS, Responsive Desing with Bootstrap, and Gear Up for Success on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** A nice refresher of the HTML/CSS stuff, and signed up for a bunch of websites. Also committed to $10 a month for HackClub!

### Day 2: December 31, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery tutorial on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Funny to see the end animation of the hinge animation class. Looking forward to the Basic FrontEnd Development Projects to apply some of my awesome CSS/HTML5/jQuery knowledge!

### Day 3: January 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first Basic Front End Development project, "Build A Tribute Page".

**Thoughts** Not that complicated. The hardest part was to find the correct syntax for the responsive image format, and some timeline info to put under the picture.

### Day 4: January 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working on the second Basic Front End Development project, "Build A Personal Portfolio Page".

**Thoughts** Wow. Lots of options to create a menu with links. But it looks like Bootstrap Scrollspy is by far the coolest solution. Still working on it.

### Day 5: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on the second Basic Front End Development project, "Build A Personal Portfolio Page". Playing around with the navbar object, figured out padding to prevent the navbar from overlaying the contents.

**Thoughts** Amazing how powerful this one object is.

### Day 6: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Something completely different. A presentation by Brian Lanham on Microservices in .NET, using Vert.x. Ties in nicely with the Docker stuff I've been doing!

**Thoughts** Microservices are definitely a thing to come.

### Day 7: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Struggling to make the headers on the personal portfolio follow along with the position on the page. I tried several examples, but no luck.

**Thoughts** I'm not sure the navbar automatically supports that.

### Day 8: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the headers for the different sections following along when someone scrolls.

**Thoughts** I'm missing something... is this JavaScript driven?

### Day 9: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tried several more examples, but I am ready to leave it alone. The navbar has tons of options, but I can't find the one that makes the section and the menu sync.

**Thoughts** Looking forward to the Javascript part of the FreeCodeCamp!

### Day 10: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Docker time! Worked through a workshop to create an Amazon Load Balanced Cluster, with a simple web app. Not much coding, but understanding how AWS is set up and how the various pieces work together.

**Thoughts** I now see the need for automating Continuous Deployment. Wow, that's a lot of steps to deploy a new version.
